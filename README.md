# ✨ React Particle Animation  

This repository contains a **lightweight, interactive particle animation** built using **React and the HTML5 Canvas API**. The effect creates a **dynamic network of particles** that move and connect with smooth animations, reacting to user mouse movements.  

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Dynamic Particle System** – Particles move independently and interact with each other.  
✅ **Mouse Interaction** – Particles respond to the cursor, forming connections.  
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering.  
✅ **Responsive Design** – Adapts to different screen sizes.  
✅ **Minimal & Customizable** – Easily tweak particle count, colors, opacity, and behavior.  

## 🛠 How It Works  

- **Canvas Rendering**: Uses a `<canvas>` element for drawing particles and lines.  
- **Random Particle Movement**: Particles are initialized with random positions and velocities.  
- **Mouse Interaction**: The cursor acts as an attractor, pulling nearby particles closer.  
- **Edge Bouncing**: Particles bounce back when they reach screen edges.  
- **Connection Lines**: Particles within a certain range are connected with lines, with opacity based on distance.  

## 📌 Setup & Usage  

1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-particle-animation.git
   cd react-particle-animation

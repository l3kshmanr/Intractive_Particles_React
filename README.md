# This repository contains a lightweight, interactive particle animation built using React and the HTML5 Canvas API. The effect creates a dynamic network of particles that move and connect with smooth animations, reacting to user mouse movements.

🚀 Features
✅ Dynamic Particle System – Particles move independently and interact with each other.
✅ Mouse Interaction – Particles respond to the cursor, forming connections.
✅ Optimized Performance – Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering.
✅ Responsive Design – Adapts to different screen sizes.
✅ Minimal & Customizable – Easily tweak particle count, colors, opacity, and behavior.

🛠 How It Works
Canvas Rendering: Uses a <canvas> element for drawing particles and lines.
Random Particle Movement: Particles are initialized with random positions and velocities.
Mouse Interaction: The cursor acts as an attractor, pulling nearby particles closer.
Edge Bouncing: Particles bounce back when they reach screen edges.
Connection Lines: Particles within a certain range are connected with lines, with opacity based on distance.
